# Pocket Function_generator
  The project was aiming to learn the analog approach of circuit designing from scratch provides almost all types of features like, sine, triangular, square, TTL, ext./Int. PWM conversion, adjustable DC offset and variable amplitude (0.3 to 20V p-p) with variable frequency within various frequency ranges. The small design having up to 50â„¦ load driving capacity.
